# ExcelToCSV

 Simple converter made with Pandas

## Setup

    Setup is pretty simple 😀
1. Download the [ExcelToCSV.py](ExcelToCSV.py);
2. Import the class XlsToCSV;
3. Set file path(s):
    1. Use a list, or a text file as used at [test.py](test.py), to load a list of paths.
    2. Or if you want to convert just a single file, you can set it's path directly to the converter.
4. Set the destination folder path as your wish (default is the same folder the script is stored);
5. Your file(s) will be converted! 😁

## Prints

    Quick Note: The 2 files converted had about 56MB, 500K+ rows each and after the conversion using gzip compression they had about 17MB.
